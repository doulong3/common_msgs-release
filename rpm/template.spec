%description
This package holds the diagnostic messages which provide the standardized
interface for the diagnostic and runtime monitoring systems in ROS. These
messages are currently used by the diagnostics Stack, which provides libraries
for simple ways to set and access the messages, as well as automated ways to
process the diagnostic data. These messages are used for long term logging and
will not be changed unless there is a very important reason.
